# NODE-SSDP

An async/await implementation of the **S**imple **S**ervice **D**iscovery **P**rotocol for NodeJS.

## Motivation

To create a minimal, clean and async implementation.
Most of the similar projects out there are unmantained and based on callbacks.

See [diversario/node-ssdp](https://github.com/diversario/node-ssdp) for a more complete and maintained solution.

## Install

Install directly from Github with `npm i --save github:WeAreOur/node-ssdp`

## Usage

### M-SEARCH

(See [m-search](https://github.com/WeAreOur/node-ssdp/blob/main/src/ssdp-methods/m-search.md))

```
import SSDP from '@weareour/node-ssdp';
const message = await SSDP.mSearch({ serviceType });
```
